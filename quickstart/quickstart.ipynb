This experiment is to test a new version of a search algorithm that powers a product search on a website. Ultimately, we're interested in testing if this new version drives more sales.\n\nA few callouts about this experiment:\n\n* We specify the `datascience` lab as its parent.\n* We specify our `anonymous_id` subject type as the one to use when creating assignments.\n* This initial release has just two variants: `control` and `v2`, launched with a 50/50 split in the initial cohort.\n\n**Note about statuses**\n \nEach resource has a `status` field to denote its lifecycle stage (e.g., `draft` vs `active`). For the sake of simplicity, this experiment is created as `active`, which will make it immediately available for generating assignments. In the real world, we'd like create it as a `draft` while we build it out to have it ready for launch and would set it to `active` only when we're ready to launch the experiment.\n"
